To use the separated constants for width and height in your C++ program, you can take advantage of a modular approach for maintaining your program's configuration. Begin by creating a new header file, let's call it Constants.h, where you define the constants WIDTH and HEIGHT. By doing so, you ensure that these values are easily accessible and consistent throughout your codebase. In your main C++ file, include the Constants.h header using #include "Constants.h". This allows you to directly reference WIDTH and HEIGHT in your program, enhancing code readability and maintainability. By encapsulating these constants in a separate file, you can effortlessly modify the canvas dimensions whenever needed, without affecting the rest of your code. This modular approach simplifies the management of fundamental program properties, making your code more organized and adaptable as your project evolves.
